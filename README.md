## 🧠 Overview

Anomaly detection in financial transactions is critical for preventing fraud and maintaining trust in financial systems. This project implements various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to detect outliers and flag potentially fraudulent transactions based on patterns in historical data.

## ✨ Features

- Preprocessing of raw transactional data
- Outlier detection using statistical & ML-based techniques
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Visualization of anomalies and model performance
- Scalable and modular codebase

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Notebook**: Jupyter / VS Code

## 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ajay-at-github/AENN-for-Financial-Transaction-Anomaly-Detection.git
````

## 🏋️ Model Training

We support:

* **Unsupervised Models**: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM
* **Neural Networks**: Autoencoders for anomaly reconstruction

Example training snippet:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)
model.fit(X_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall / F1-Score
* ROC-AUC
* Confusion Matrix

## ✅ Results

* Achieved **95%+ AUC** on benchmark datasets
* Detected significant outliers with minimal false positives
* Visualizations highlight temporal and feature-wise anomalies
